# RL-Vehicle-Routing-Optimization

This repository provides a reinforcement learning (RL) agent for optimizing vehicle routing in dynamic traffic conditions, demonstrating the practical application of RL algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create an intelligent agent capable of navigating and optimizing vehicle routes in dynamic traffic environments using reinforcement learning techniques. The agent will make optimal decisions based on current traffic conditions, road networks, and other relevant factors.

## Features

- RL algorithm implementation for vehicle routing and navigation optimization.
- Creation of a simulated environment to model dynamic traffic conditions and road networks.
- Training the reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal routing strategies.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the agent's performance, efficiency, and scalability.
